# DomiKnowSNLUI

## Abstract
This demo presents a conversational pipeline for crafting complex neuro-symbolic models through natural language prompts. It leverages large language models to generate declarative programs in the DomiKnowS framework. The programs in this framework express concepts and their relationships as a graph in addition to logical constraints between them. The graph will be connected to underling neural models. Our proposed pipeline utilizes techniques like dynamic in-context demonstration retrieval, model refinement based on feedback from a symbolic parser, visualization, and user interaction to generate the tasksâ€™ structure and formal knowledge representation. This approach empowers domain experts, even those not well-versed in ML/AI, to design customized neural models that can incorporate their respective domain knowledge.
