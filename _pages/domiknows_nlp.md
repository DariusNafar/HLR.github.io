# DomiKnowS-NLP

## Abstract
This library is for designing deep learning architectures for the problems that have structured output when this structure can be expressed symbolically using logical constraints between output concepts. Our showcases mostly focus on NLP problems.  Though the language models have taken over in many NLP tasks, using explicit knowledge about the domain or world can be helpful for generalizability beyond the observed data and explain-ability of the decisions.  Though there are several approaches for such an integration of symbolic and subsymbolic models, currently, there is no library to facilitate the programming for such an integration in a generic way and the models need to be hard coded task-specifically. Our library aims to facilitate programming for such an integration.
