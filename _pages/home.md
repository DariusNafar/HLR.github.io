# Welcome to the **Heterogeneous Learning and Reasoning** Lab

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/picpic/AI_web.jpg" width="100%">

We are interested in research on machine learning, natural language processing and combining vision and language. We work on  information and semantic extraction from language. We investigate methodologies to interplay between learning and reasoning and develop techniques to include declarative and procedural knowledge in statistical/neural learning. We develop research software and build prototypes to facilitate designing AI systems. We also aim to apply our techniques and tools on real world-problems and conduct multi-disciplinary research to impact the society for making the world a better place to live.
