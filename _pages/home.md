# Welcome to the Heterogeneous Learning and Reasoning Lab

We are interested in research on machine learning, natural language processing and combing vision and language. We perform information and semantic extraction from language. We investigate methodologies to interplay between learning and reasoning and develop techniques to include declarative and procedural knowledge in statistical/neural learning. We develop research software and build prototypes to facilitate designing AI systems. We also aim to apply our techniques and tools on real world-problems and perform multi-disciplinary research to impact the society for making the world a better place to live.
