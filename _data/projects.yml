  description: Neuro-Symbolic Compositional Generalization for Language and Vision Comprehension and Grounding
  info: The goal of this research is to develop a Neuro-symbolic framework to address compositional generalization in a principled way inspired by human cross-situational learning of basic concepts and their compositions and study the formal and functional properties of concept composition. We exploit the current gigantic transformer-based vision and language architectures that convey implicit world knowledge and equip them with symbolic and explicit knowledge to improve their generalization and reasoning for interactive language comprehension and grounding in vision. We further equip our existing framework for integrating knowledge in deep learning (DomiKnowS) with the techniques developed in this proposed research.

  description: A Declarative Learning Based Programming Framework For Integration of <strong>Dom</strong>ain <strong>Know</strong>ledge in <strong>S</strong>tatistical Learning.
  info: We seek for abstractions that facilitate writing programs that can learn from data. We are interested in languages that can help in integration of learning and reasoning formalisms and the formulation of declarative and procedural domain knowledge for learners.

  info: Our goal is to investigate the generic domain-independent spatial meaning representation schemes that can help in tasks that involve spatial language understanding. We exploit domain knowledge including ontologies that convey common-sense, the axioms of spatial qualitative reasoning and external visual resources in an integrate learning and reasoning framework. We develop deep structured and relational learning techniques for this goal and investigate the interaction between learning and spatial reasoning. We evaluate the capabilities of deep structured models in learning qualitative representations and the impact of those representations on textual and visual question answering tasks, focusing on locative questions.
